This task tracker at its base allows you to save items, and then edit and delete them. Additonally we had to deploy to AWS, adda README.md file, and should use a TXT file or JSON to store data that would include your tasks.

The skills used to make this project were mostly javascript, html, and css.

The thing that I struggled with the mostly was finding out how to do it. I was trying to use a backend focused version and I could never figure out how to work it. So I did a workaround and created another version that I am currently presenting/showing. The trouble with this version was figuring how to link thhe JSON with everything else without using an API. Which is how I was doing it before. Had to change my approach to it/how i viewed it and it helped alot
